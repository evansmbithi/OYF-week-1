# <a href="" target="_blank">Tax Calculator</a>

This project was part of the <a href="https://www.meliora.co.ke/articles/nvrjgtnsgh5ophs6mm">Overcome-your-fear-Bootcamp</a> challenge series. The bootcamp involved weekly challenges that enabled participants collaborate in teams to design, build, and deploy a simple Tax Calculator among other <a href="#">projects</a>.

## Week One

Created a responsive UI for:

- Large screen UI
- Mobile screen UI <br/>

Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Week Two

Containerized the web app with docker and pushed to
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mbithi/oyf-week-one">docker hub.</a> <br>
** See it live <a href="http://157.230.13.246/group7/">here</a> **

## Week Three

Developed an API to compute tax deductions based on KRA specifications. <br><br>
Also learnt to initialize and run a MySQL instance on docker. From which we were able to create and query a DB from the commandline.

## Week Four

Learnt Angular and TypeScript, then used that knowledge to consume the API we created in week three.
